# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning classification task using the Iris dataset. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on features like petal and sepal length/width.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand the structure of the Iris dataset
- Visualize feature relationships
- Train a classification model using Logistic Regression
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and classification report

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Steps Followed
1. Imported necessary libraries
2. Loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`
3. Converted the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
4. Visualized feature relationships using pairplot
5. Split the data into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Logistic Regression model
7. Evaluated the model using confusion matrix and classification report

## ✅ What I Learned
- How to load and explore a built-in dataset
- How to visualize data using seaborn
- How to train and evaluate a simple classification model
- How to interpret model performance metrics

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try other classifiers like KNN or Random Forest
- Deploy the model using Streamlit for interactive predictions
- Add feature scaling and cross-validation
